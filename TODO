TODO:

* Multiprocess capabilty using either:
   - threads (particularly in CVT and *TL that call CompressStrip and Compress )
   - Asynchronous via asio or libevent
* ICC transformation via lcms library
* Lossless Rotation / transposition support for JPEG tiles
* JPEG source image support
* Look into using malloc_usable_size to trace real allocated space
* Copy EXIF, IPTC data for CVT exports
* Rewrite JPEG writer code for better buffered output
